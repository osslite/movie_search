# movie_search
If you are on some local network and have some DLNA servers, it will show all files from them.
Also it checks all TV's (or media renderers) and try to start the selected movie on chosen tv.

## Used technologies
* uPnP protocol for searching tv's and DLNA servers
* react-native for whole application
* materil-ui components - thanks for project xotahal/react-native-material-ui
